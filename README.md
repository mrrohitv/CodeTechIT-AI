Introduction:
               This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing a rule-based chatbot. 
               The chatbot is designed to respond to user inputs based on predefined rules using if-else statements or pattern matching techniques. 
               The purpose of this chatbot is to demonstrate basic natural language processing and conversation flow principles.
1. Overview:
The rule-based chatbot is a simple conversational agent that operates by analyzing user inputs and providing appropriate responses based on predefined rules. It does not utilize machine learning or advanced natural language processing techniques but relies on basic if-else statements or pattern matching for identifying user queries.

2. Installation:
There is no specific installation required for the rule-based chatbot as it's implemented in a programming language such as Python. Users need to have Python installed on their system to run the chatbot script.

3. Usage:
Users can interact with the chatbot by running the provided Python script. Upon execution, the chatbot will prompt the user to enter their query, to which the chatbot will respond accordingly based on predefined rules.

4. Code Explanation:
The code for the rule-based chatbot typically consists of two main components:

Input Processing: This involves capturing and preprocessing user inputs.
Response Generation: This involves determining the appropriate response based on predefined rules.

5. Example Interactions:
Below are examples of interactions between the user and the rule-based chatbot:

User: Hello!
Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?

User: How are you?
Bot: I'm just a bot, but thanks for asking!

User: What's the weather like today?
Bot: I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.

User: Bye!
Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day!

6. Conclusion:
The rule-based chatbot provides a simple yet effective way of implementing conversational agents without the need for complex machine learning models. By defining clear rules for input processing and response generation, the chatbot can engage in basic conversations with users. However, it may lack the ability to handle complex queries or understand context, which limits its applicability in certain scenarios. Overall, the rule-based chatbot serves as a valuable learning tool for understanding natural language processing and conversation flow principles.
